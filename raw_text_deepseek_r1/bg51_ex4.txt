[CODE]  
public class Shape {  
    public void draw() {  
        System.out.println("Drawing shape");  
    }  
}  
public class Circle extends Shape {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Shape shape = new Shape();  
        Circle circle = shape;  
        circle.draw();  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Assigning a superclass (Shape) instance to a subclass (Circle) variable without proper casting, leading to a type error.  
KH: Use explicit downcasting (e.g., Circle circle = (Circle) shape;) only if the Shape instance is actually a Circle.
