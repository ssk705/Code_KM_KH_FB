[CODE]  
public interface Shape {  
    void draw();  
}  
class Circle implements Shape {  
    public void draw() {  
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");  
    }  
    public void draw() {  
        System.out.println("Drawing another circle");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The 'draw()' method from the 'Shape' interface is implemented twice in 'Circle', causing duplication.  
KH: Implement the 'draw()' method only once in the class to adhere to interface contract rules.
