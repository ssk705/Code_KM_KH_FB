[CODE]
public class Animal {
    Animal() {}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        System.out.println("Dog created");
        super();
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The `System.out.println` statement precedes the `super()` call, violating the rule that `super` must be the first statement in a constructor.  
KH: Reorder the statements so that `super()` is the first line in the constructor, followed by other statements.
