public class SumNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0, i < 5, i++) {

[OUTPUT]
KM: Commas are used to separate the initialization, condition, and update parts of the for loop instead of semicolons.
KH: Replace commas between the loop components (after initialization and condition) with semicolons to follow Java syntax rules.
