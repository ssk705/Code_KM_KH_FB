[CODE]  
public class Test {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Object str = "hello";  
        System.out.println(str.substring(1));  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The variable `str` is declared as `Object`, which does not have the `substring()` method, even though the actual object is a `String`.  
KH: Declare `str` as a `String` type or cast it to `String` before calling `substring()`.
