[CODE]  
public class VariableInit {  
    int x;  
    x = 5;  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Value initialized");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The assignment statement `x = 5;` is outside any method or initializer block, which is invalid syntax.  
KH: Initialize `x` directly during declaration (e.g., `int x = 5;`) or move the assignment into a method/constructor.
