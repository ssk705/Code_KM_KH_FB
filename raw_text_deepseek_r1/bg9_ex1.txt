[CODE]  
public class Greet {  
    public static void greet(); {  
        System.out.println("Hello!");  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        greet();  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: A semicolon is incorrectly placed after the method header `greet();`, causing the method body to be treated as a separate block.  
KH: Remove the semicolon after the method header to properly associate the body with the method declaration.
