[CODE]
public class Base { Base() {} }
class Derived extends Base {
    Derived() {
        initialize();
        super();
    }
    void initialize() {}
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The method `initialize()` is called before `super()`, which is invalid because the parent class must be initialized before any methods are called.  
KH: Ensure `super()` is the first statement in the constructor. Move the method call after `super()`.
