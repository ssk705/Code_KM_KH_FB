[CODE]  
public class PhysicsLab {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int distance = 7;  
        int time = 2;  
        double speed = distance / time;  
        System.out.println(speed); // Prints 3.0 instead of 3.5  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The division of distance by time (7/2) is evaluated as 3 (integer division), leading to speed being 3.0.  
KH: Modify the division to use at least one double operand (e.g., distance / (time * 1.0)) to compute the correct value.
