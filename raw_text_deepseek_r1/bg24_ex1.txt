[CODE]
public class SumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum;
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The variable 'sum' is not initialized before use, leading to a compilation error. Local variables in Java must be initialized before they are accessed.
KH: Initialize 'sum' with 0 before the loop to accumulate the total correctly.
