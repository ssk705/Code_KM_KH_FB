[CODE]
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private int year;
    public Car(String m, int y) {
        model = m;
        year = y;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The constructor Car() is undefined because the class defines a constructor with two parameters (String and int), but the object is instantiated without any arguments.  
KH: Pass a String and an int as arguments when creating the Car object, or define a no-argument constructor in the Car class.
