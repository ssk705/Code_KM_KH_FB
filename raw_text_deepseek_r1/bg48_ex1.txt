KM:You are attempting to downcast an `Animal` object to `Dog`, but `myAnimal` is not actually a `Dog` instance.  This causes a `ClassCastException` at runtime because the object's true type (`Animal`) isn't compatible with `Dog`.  
KH: Ensure the object is an instance of `Dog` before casting using `instanceof`.  Alternatively, create a `Dog` object instead of `Animal` if you need `Dog`-specific features.
