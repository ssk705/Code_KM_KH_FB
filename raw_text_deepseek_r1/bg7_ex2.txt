[CODE]  
public class Calculator {  
    public void void() {  
        System.out.println("This method does nothing.");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Using the keyword 'void' as a method name, which is not allowed because 'void' is a reserved keyword for method return types.  
KH: Rename the method to a valid identifier, like 'doNothing' or 'emptyMethod'.
