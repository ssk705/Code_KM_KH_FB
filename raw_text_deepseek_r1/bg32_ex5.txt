[CODE]  
public class Tree {  
    public Tree() {}  
}  

public class Forest {  
    public Tree getTree() {  
        return new Tree;  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The return statement attempts to create a Tree object without parentheses, which is invalid.  
KH: Correct the return statement by adding parentheses to the constructor: 'return new Tree();'.
