    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int x = 3;  
        if (x > 0); {

[OUTPUT]  
KM: A semicolon is incorrectly placed after the `if` condition, causing the code block to execute unconditionally.  
KH: Remove the semicolon after the `if` condition to ensure the block executes only when the condition is true.
