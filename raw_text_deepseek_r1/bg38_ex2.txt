class Vehicle {
    private void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        startEngine();  // Attempt to use inherited method
    }
}
KM:Private methods like `startEngine()` are not inherited by subclasses. `Car` cannot directly access `Vehicle`'s private method.  
KH:Change `startEngine()` to `protected` or `public` in `Vehicle`, or declare a new public method in `Car` to handle the functionality.
