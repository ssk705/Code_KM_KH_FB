[CODE]
public class ArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr;
        arr[0] = 10;
        System.out.println(arr[0]);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The array 'arr' is declared but not initialized with a new instance, leading to a NullPointerException when accessing its elements.
KH: Initialize 'arr' with a new int array of the desired size (e.g., int[] arr = new int[1];) before assigning values to its elements.
