[CODE]  
public class Counter {  
    private int count = 0;  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println(Count);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The field 'Count' does not exist; variable names are case-sensitive in Java. The correct field name is 'count'.  
KH: Ensure the variable name matches the declared field exactly, including case sensitivity.
