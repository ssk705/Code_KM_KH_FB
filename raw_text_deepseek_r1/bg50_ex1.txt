[CODE]
public class Example1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        if (x > 5) {
            System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
        
        else {
            System.out.println("x is 5 or less");
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:if block is missing a closing brace, causing the else to be unmatched
KH:add the closing brace after the if's statements.
