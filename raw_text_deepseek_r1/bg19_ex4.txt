[CODE]  
abstract class Device {  
    abstract void powerOn();  
}  
class Phone extends Device {  
    void powerOn(int batteryLevel) {  
        System.out.println("Phone powered on");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The 'powerOn(int)' method in 'Phone' does not correctly override 'powerOn()' in 'Device' due to mismatched parameters, leaving the class abstract.  
KH: Correct the method signature of 'powerOn()' in 'Phone' to match the abstract method (no parameters) to resolve the error.
