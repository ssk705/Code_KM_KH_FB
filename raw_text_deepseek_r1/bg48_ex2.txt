KM:Downcasting `v` (a `Vehicle` instance) to `Car` fails because `v` isn't a `Car`.  The compiler allows this cast syntactically, but at runtime, `v` lacks `Car`'s properties.  
KH:Only downcast when you are certain the object is of the target type (e.g., if `v` was created as `new Car().Verify the type with `if (v instanceof Car)` before casting.
