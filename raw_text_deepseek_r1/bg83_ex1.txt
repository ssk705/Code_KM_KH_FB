[CODE]  
public class Student {  
    private String name;  
    public Student(String name) { this.name = name; }  
    public String ToString() {  
        return "Student: " + name;  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Student s = new Student("Alice");  
        System.out.println(s);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The method `ToString` is defined with an uppercase 'T' and 'S', which does not override the `toString()` method from the Object class. This results in the default `Object.toString()` being called.  
KH: Rename the method to `toString` with a lowercase 't' and 's' to properly override the method and ensure the custom string is used.
