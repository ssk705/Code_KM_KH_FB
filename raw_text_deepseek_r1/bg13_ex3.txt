[CODE]  
public class CastExample3 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int a = 5, b = 2;  
        double result = (double) (a / b);  
        System.out.println("Expected 2.5, got: " + result);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Integer division occurs first, yielding 2, which is then cast to double (2.0).  
KH: Cast one operand to double before division: `(double) a / b`.
