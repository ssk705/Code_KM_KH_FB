[CODE]
public class Test {{
    public static void main(String[] args) {{
        x = 10;
        System.out.println(x);
    }}
}}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Variable 'x' is used without being declared with a type. Java requires explicit type declaration for variables.
KH: Declare 'x' with the appropriate data type, such as 'int x = 10;' before using it.
