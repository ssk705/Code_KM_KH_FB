      public class Example2 {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              int a = 10;
              int b = 20;
              a + b;
          }
      }

   KM: The expression 'a + b' is not a valid statement because it does not perform an assignment nor a method call. It is an expression without a side effect.
   KH: Either assign the result of the expression to a variable or remove it if it is not needed.
