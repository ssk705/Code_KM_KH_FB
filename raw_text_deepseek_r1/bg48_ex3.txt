KM:`fruit` is a `Banana`, not an `Apple`. Casting to `Apple` is invalid.  The inheritance hierarchy (`Banana` and `Apple` are siblings) makes them incompatible for direct casting.  
KH: Check the object's actual type with `instanceof` before casting.Ensure the reference points to an `Apple` object if you need `Apple`-specific methods.
