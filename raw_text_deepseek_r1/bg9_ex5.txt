[CODE]  
public class Animal {  
    public void makeSound(); {  
        System.out.println("Generic sound");  
    }  
}  
class Dog extends Animal {  
    @Override  
    public void makeSound(); {  
        System.out.println("Bark");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The semicolons after both `makeSound();` method headers in the parent and child classes disconnect their bodies from the method declarations.  
KH: Remove the semicolons after the method headers in both classes to ensure the method bodies are properly defined.
