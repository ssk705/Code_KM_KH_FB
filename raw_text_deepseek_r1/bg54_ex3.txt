[CODE]  
interface Drawable {  
    void draw();  
}  
class Circle implements Drawable {  
    // No draw method  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The `Circle` class implements the `Drawable` interface but does not define the required `draw` method, leading to a compilation error.  
KH: Add a `public void draw()` method in `Circle` to implement the drawing logic for a circle.
