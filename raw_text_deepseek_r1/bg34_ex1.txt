[CODE]  
public class Vehicl {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Vehicle");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Class name 'Vehicl' does not match the filename 'Vehicle.java', leading to a compilation error. Java requires the public class name to exactly match the filename.  
KH: Rename the class to 'Vehicle' to match the filename.
