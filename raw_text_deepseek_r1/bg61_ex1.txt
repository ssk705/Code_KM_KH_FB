[CODE]
public class Vehicle {
    public Vehicle() {}
}
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car() {
        int wheels = 4;
        super();
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The call to `super()` is not the first statement in the constructor, causing a compilation error.  
KH: Move the `super()` call to the first line of the constructor to ensure the parent class is initialized before any other operations.
