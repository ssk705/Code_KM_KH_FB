[CODE]  
public class CommentExample3 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        /* This is a nested /* comment */ attempt */  
        int y = 10;  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Nested multi-line comments are not allowed in Java; the first '*/' closes the initial '/*', leaving the rest of the code uncompiled.  
KH: Avoid nesting multi-line comments. Use single-line comments (//) inside block comments if needed.
