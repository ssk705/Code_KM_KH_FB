[CODE]  
public class Book {  
    String title;  
    public void Book() {  
        title = "Default Title";  
    }  
    public Book(String title) {  
        this.title = title;  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Book b = new Book();  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The no-argument constructor is declared with `void`, so it is treated as a method. The `new Book()` call fails because no valid constructor exists.  
KH: Remove `void` from the no-argument constructor to resolve the compilation err
