[CODE]  
public class MethodCallError {  
    public static void main(String[] args) { }  
    calculateSum(2, 3);  
    static int calculateSum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The method call `calculateSum(2, 3);` is outside any method or initializer block, which is not allowed.  
KH: Move the method call into the `main` method or another method to ensure it is executed within a valid scope.
