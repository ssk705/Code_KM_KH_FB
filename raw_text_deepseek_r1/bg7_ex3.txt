[CODE]  
public class Student {  
    String class = "Freshman";  
    public void printClass() {  
        System.out.println(class);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Using the keyword 'class' as a variable name, which is invalid because 'class' is a reserved keyword for defining classes.  
KH: Rename the variable to a non-keyword identifier, such as 'studentClass' or 'year'.
