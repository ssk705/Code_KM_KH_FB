class Employee {}
class Manager extends Employee {
    void manage() { System.out.println("Managing..."); }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee[] team = { new Employee(), new Manager() };

}
KM: The first array element (`team[0]`) is a base `Employee`, not a `Manager`.  Casting it to `Manager` fails at runtime because the object lacks `Manager`-specific traits.  
KH: Only cast objects that you know are of the target type (e.g., use `team[1]` here).Use `instanceof` to check each elementâ€™s type before casting.
