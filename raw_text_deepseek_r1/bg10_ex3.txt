[CODE]  
public class MathExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        double val = Math. abs(-5.5);  
        System.out.println(val);  
    }  
    
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The space after "Math." in "Math. abs" is considered bad style.  
KH: Remove the space between "Math." and "abs" to properly call the method as "Math.abs".
