[CODE]  
public class Student {  
    int id;  
    void setID(int id) {  
        id = id;  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The parameter 'id' is assigned to itself instead of the instance variable, leaving the instance variable unmodified.  
KH: Prefix the instance variable with 'this' (e.g., 'this.id = id;') to resolve the shadowing.
