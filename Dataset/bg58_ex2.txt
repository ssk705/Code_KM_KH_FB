[CODE]  
public class CommentExample2 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // This prints "Hello World"  
        System.out.println("Hello // World"); // Note: Slashes in the string  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The student may mistakenly believe that '//' inside the string literal acts as a comment, but it is part of the string.  
KH: Understand that comments are ignored by the compiler, but anything inside string literals is treated as text.
