[CODE]
public class Counter {
    public static int count = 0;
    
    public static void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        c1.increment();   
        System.out.println(Counter.count);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: increment() is a static method but invoked through an instance (c1). Static methods should always be called via the class name, regardless of whether instance creation is syntactically allowed.
KH: Use Counter.increment() instead of c1.increment() to clarify it's a class-level operation.
