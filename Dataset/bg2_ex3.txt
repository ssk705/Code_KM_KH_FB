[CODE]
public class LoopCondition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i = 5) {
            System.out.println("Looping...");
            i++;
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The assignment 'i = 5' in the while condition causes a compilation error because it evaluates to an int, not a boolean. This also creates an infinite loop if not fixed.
KH: Replace '=' with '==' to check if i equals 5. Adjust the loop logic if the goal is to iterate until i reaches 5.
