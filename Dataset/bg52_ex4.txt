[CODE]
public class Student {
    public Student(String name, int id) { }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Alice");
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The constructor Student(String) is undefined. The Student class expects two parameters (String name and int id), but only one argument is provided.  
KH: Include both a String (name) and an int (id) as arguments when instantiating the Student object.
