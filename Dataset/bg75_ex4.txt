[CODE]  
public class Printer {  
    public void printMessage();  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The printMessage method lacks a body. Non-abstract methods in concrete classes must have implementations.  
KH: Either provide a method body using {} or declare the method as abstract and make the class abstract.
