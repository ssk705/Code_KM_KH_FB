[CODE]  
public class CheckValue {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int a = 5;  
        if (a == 5 6) {  
            System.out.println("a is 5 or 6");  
        }  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Missing logical operator '||' between '5' and '6' to check if 'a' is either 5 or 6.  
KH: Use '||' between '5' and '6' and ensure proper comparison (e.g., 'a == 5 || a == 6').
