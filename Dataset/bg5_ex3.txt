[CODE]
public class MultiVariableLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int a = 5, b = 0, a > b, a--, b++) {
            System.out.println(a + " vs " + b);
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Commas are incorrectly used to separate the loop's initialization, condition, and update sections. Commas in the initialization for multiple variables are correct, but semicolons are required after initialization and condition.
KH: Replace the first two commas after the initialization (between `b = 0` and `a > b`) with semicolons, while keeping commas within the initialization and update sections as needed.
