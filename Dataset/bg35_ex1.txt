KM:When a superclass lacks a default constructor, subclasses must explicitly call an existing superclass constructor using `super(...)` as the first line in their own constructor 
KH:Ensure the subclass constructor explicitly invokes one of the superclassâ€™s declared constructors using `super(arguments)`. This call must be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
