[CODE]  
public class AverageCalculator {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int sum = 9;  
        int count = 2;  
        double average = sum / count;  
        System.out.println(average);   
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The division of two integers (sum and count) results in an integer (4), which is then implicitly cast to a double (4.0), truncating the decimal part.  
KH: Cast one of the operands to double before division (e.g., (double)sum / count) to ensure floating-point division.
