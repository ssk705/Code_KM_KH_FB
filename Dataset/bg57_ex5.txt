[CODE]  
public class ConditionalError {  
    public static void main(String[] args) { }  
    if (true) {  
        System.out.println("This is always true");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The `if` statement is placed directly in the class body, not inside a method, resulting in a compilation error.  
KH: Place the `if` block inside a method, such as `main`, to ensure it is part of executable code.
