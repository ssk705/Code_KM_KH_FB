[CODE]  
public class PrintReverse {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  
        int i = arr.length - 1;  
        while (i >= 0)  
            System.out.println(arr[i]);  
            i--;  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Missing braces in the while loop cause the decrement (`i--`) to execute only once, leading to an infinite loop.  
KH: Add braces to include both the print statement and `i--` in the loop body, or use a for loop to manage the index automatically.
