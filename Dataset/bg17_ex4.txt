public class Student {
    String name;
    public Student(String name) { this.name = name; }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Alice");
        Student s2 = s1;

KM:Assigning `s2 = s1` copies the *object reference*, not the object itself. Both variables point to the same `Student` object.Modifying `s2` affects `s1` because they reference the same object, leading to unintended side effects.  

KH:To create independent copies, explicitly construct a new object (e.g., `new Student(s1.name)`). Understand that assignment (`=`) between objects shares references, not data.
