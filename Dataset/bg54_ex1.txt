[CODE]  
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {  
    private int id;  
    public Student(int id) { this.id = id; }  
     
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The class `Student` implements `Comparable<Student>` but does not define the required `compareTo` method, causing a compilation error.  
KH: Add a `public int compareTo(Student other)` method to compare `id` or another relevant field and return a negative, zero, or positive integer.
