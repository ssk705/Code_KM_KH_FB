[CODE]
public class LoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count;
        while (count < 5) {
            System.out.println(count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The variable 'count' is used in the loop condition without being initialized, causing a compilation error. Local variables must have a value before they are read.
KH: Assign an initial value to 'count' (e.g., 0) before the while loop starts.
