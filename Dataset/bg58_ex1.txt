[CODE]  
public class CommentExample1 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int x = 5;  
        /* This is a comment to explain x  
        System.out.println("x is " + x);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The multi-line comment is not properly closed with '*/', causing the code below it to be treated as part of the comment and leading to a compilation error.  
KH: Add the closing '*/' at the end of the comment block to ensure the code is parsed correctly.
