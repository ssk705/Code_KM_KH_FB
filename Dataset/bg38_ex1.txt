}
KM:id` is declared `private` in `Student`, so it's inaccessible outside the `Student` class. Direct access in `Main` causes a compilation error.  
KH:Declare a public getter method (e.g., `public int getId()`) in `Student` to access `id` from other classes.

[CODE]
public class Test {{
    public static void main(String[] args) {{
        x = 10;
        System.out.println(x);
    }}
}}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Variable 'x' is used without being declared with a type. Java requires explicit type declaration for variables.
KH: Declare 'x' with the appropriate data type, such as 'int x = 10;' before using it.
