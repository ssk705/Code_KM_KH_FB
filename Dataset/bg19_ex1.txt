[CODE]  
interface Sound {  
    void makeSound();  
    void stopSound();  
}  
class Animal implements Sound {  
    public void makeSound() {  
        System.out.println("Animal sound");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The class 'Animal' does not implement the 'stopSound()' method declared in the 'Sound' interface, forcing it to be abstract.  
KH: Add the missing 'stopSound()' method in the 'Animal' class or declare the class as abstract if it shouldn't be instantiated.
