[CODE]  
public class CommentExample5 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
         
        int z = 20;  
        // System.out.println(z);  
        System.out.println("Done");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The comment "// Then we print z" is misleading because the line it's on does not print z; the actual print statement is commented out.  
KH: Ensure comments accurately describe the adjacent code. Uncomment the correct line if printing z was intended.
