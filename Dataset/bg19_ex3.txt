[CODE]  
interface Drawable {  
    void draw();  
    void resize();  
}  
class Circle implements Drawable {  
    public void draw() {  
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The 'Circle' class is missing the 'resize()' method required by the 'Drawable' interface, causing it to be abstract.  
KH: Define the 'resize()' method in 'Circle' to fulfill the interface contract or declare 'Circle' as abstract.
