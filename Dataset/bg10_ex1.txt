public class HelloWorld {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System. out.println("Hello, World!");  
    }  
    
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: A space is incorrectly placed after the period in "System. out.println". the space after the period is considered bad style 
KH: Remove the space between the period and "out" to correctly call the method as "System.out.println".
