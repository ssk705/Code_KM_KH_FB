[CODE]
class Shape {}
class Circle extends Shape {
    void drawCircle() { System.out.println("Drawing circle"); }
}
public class Main {
    static void draw(Shape s) {
        Circle c = (Circle) s;  
        c.drawCircle();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Shape();
        draw(shape);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The `draw` method assumes all `Shape` objects are `Circle` instances, which is incorrect.  Passing a generic `Shape` to `draw` causes a `ClassCastException` since `Shape` isn't a `Circle`.  
KH: Validate the input type with `s instanceof Circle` before casting. Redesign the method to handle `Shape` polymorphically (e.g., override methods in subclasses).
