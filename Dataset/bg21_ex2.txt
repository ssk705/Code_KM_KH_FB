[CODE]  
class Animal {}  
class Dog extends Animal { String breed = "Labrador"; }  
public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Animal myPet = new Dog();  
        System.out.println(myPet.breed);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The field 'breed' belongs to the Dog class, but the reference type Animal does not have this field.  
KH: Cast myPet to Dog (e.g., ((Dog) myPet).breed) or declare myPet as Dog to access the subclass field.
