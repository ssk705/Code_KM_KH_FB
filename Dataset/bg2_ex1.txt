[CODE]
public class CheckEquality {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 7;
        if (x = 7) {
            System.out.println("x is 7");
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Using the assignment operator '=' instead of the equality operator '==' in the if condition, which causes a compilation error because the result is an int, not a boolean.
KH: Replace '=' with '==' in the if condition to check if x equals 7 instead of assigning 7 to x.
