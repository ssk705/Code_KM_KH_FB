[CODE]
public class Parent {
    Parent(int x) {}
}
class Child extends Parent {
    Child(int a) {
        int x = a * 2;
        super(x);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The variable `x` is declared and assigned before `super()`, which is not allowed.  
KH: Calculate the value for `x` directly within the `super()` call (e.g., `super(a * 2)`) to avoid needing intermediate statements.
