[CODE]  
public class Percentage {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int correctAnswers = 15;  
        int totalQuestions = 20;  
        double percentage = (correctAnswers / totalQuestions) * 100;  
        System.out.println(percentage); // Prints 0.0 instead of 75.0  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Integer division of correctAnswers by totalQuestions (15/20) results in 0, which is then multiplied by 100, yielding 0.0.  
KH: Convert one operand to double (e.g., correctAnswers * 1.0 / totalQuestions) to perform floating-point division.
