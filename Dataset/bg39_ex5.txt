[CODE]
public class Printer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 + );
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The `+` operator requires an identifier/variable/value after it (`5 + ` is incomplete).  
KH: Provide a valid expression after `+`, such as a number, variable, or method call.
