[CODE]  
public class WhileLoopError {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int count = 0;  
        while (count < 5); {  
            System.out.println(count);  
            count++;  
        }  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: A semicolon after the `while` condition creates an infinite loop because the loop body is treated as empty.  
KH: Remove the semicolon after the `while` condition to attach the code block to the loop.
