public class Animal {}  
public class Dog extends Animal {  
    public void bark() { System.out.println("Woof"); }  
}  
public class Test {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Animal myPet = new Dog();  
        myPet.bark();  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The method `bark()` is defined in `Dog`, but the variable `myPet` is declared as `Animal`, which does not have this method.  
KH: Cast `myPet` to `Dog` (e.g., `((Dog) myPet).bark()`) or declare `myPet` as `Dog` to access `bark()`.
