public class ScopeExample {{
    public static void main(String[] args) {{
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {{
            int y = i * 2;
        }}
        System.out.println(y);
    }}
}}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Variable 'y' is declared inside the for loop block and cannot be accessed outside of it due to scope limitations.
KH: Declare 'y' outside the loop before using it inside if necessary, ensuring it's within the correct scope.
