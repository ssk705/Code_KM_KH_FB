[CODE]
public class Rectangle {
    public Rectangle(int width, int height) { }
    public Rectangle(int side) { }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 20, 30);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The constructor Rectangle(int, int, int) is undefined. The class has constructors with one or two parameters, but three arguments are provided.  
KH: Use either one argument (for side) or two arguments (for width and height) when creating the Rectangle object.
