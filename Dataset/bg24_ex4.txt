[CODE]
public class ReturnExample {
    public int calculate() {
        int result;
        // Some condition that might not assign a value to result
        return result;
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The variable 'result' is not initialized before being returned, resulting in a compilation error. Local variables must be assigned a value before use.
KH: Ensure 'result' is assigned a value in all possible code paths before the return statement.
