[CODE]
public class A {
    A(String s) {}
}
class B extends A {
    B() {
        String s = "Hello";
        s += " World";
        super(s);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The `super(s)` call occurs after modifying the `s` variable, which is not permitted.  
KH: Combine the string operations directly in the `super()` argument (e.g., `super("Hello World")`) to eliminate the need for statements before `super()`.
