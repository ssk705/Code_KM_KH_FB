[CODE]  
public class Loop {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int for = 0;  
        while (for < 5) {  
            System.out.println(for);  
            for++;  
        }  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Using the keyword 'for' as a variable name, which is invalid because 'for' is a reserved keyword for loop declarations.  
KH: Rename the variable to a non-keyword identifier, such as 'counter' or 'index'.
